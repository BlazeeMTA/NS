                Supposedly a new and improved version of PUBG Mobile,<br>
                 PUBG New State takes players into a futuristic world devastated by battles but also still pretty cool-looking.<br>
                  The map of Troi itself is sleek and technologically advanced, despite the battle-damaged look.<br>
                   In particular, I appreciated the tram that travels across the map on its own,<br>
                    offering players a bit of a safe haven when they need to take a breather (or a quick ride).<br>

            <p>
                PUBG New State offers a fun battle royale experience for anyone who's looking for a so-called "new game" on mobile.<br>
                 It's great to hop into a match or two every so often, but it's not something I'll purposely lose sleep over any time soon,<br>
                  as there are sadly better ways to spend my screen time on mobile out there.<br>
                   But if you're hungry for a fresh take on the franchise, at the very least, the game should be enough to scratch that itch.<br>
