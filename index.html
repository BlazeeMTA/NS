            <p>
            In February 2021, PUBG Studios,<br>
             an internal division of Krafton (the company that publishes the game) announced the development of a game codenamed "PUBG: New State",<br>
              a separate entity to PUBG: Battlegrounds and its mobile version, set in the near-future (year 2051) as a part of the PUBG universe.<br>
            In July 2021, Krafton reported that the game surpassed 20 million pre-registrations on Google Play alone.<br>
             On 28 August the alpha testing concluded after running in 28 countries,<br>
              and the developers implemented improvements and fixes based on feedback from participating users.<br>
               In September 2021, after pre-registration opened for iOS,<br>
                the game surpassed more than 50 million pre-registrations combined on both Google Play and the App Store.<br>
            On January 27, 2022, a name change was announced, from "PUBG: New State" to "New State Mobile".<br>
             The change was subsequently made effective on all platforms.
            </p>

            <h2 id="release">Release</h2>
            <p>
                The game was released worldwide on November 11, 2021, for both iOS and Android.
